    "1. Before doing anything within this notebook, you must first upload the [`ggplace_review_crawler`](./ggplace_review_crawler/) package to the Jupyter server. You can either do this by copying everything into the appropriate container or you may do this in the WebUI accessible through http://localhost:8888.\n",
    "2. Now, because the code uses a Firfox web driver, you need to install Firefox in the running container. To do this, first run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "docker exec -u root -it docker-hadoop-spark-notebook-1 bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will run the bash shell within the spark-notebook container as the root user. Then, please follow the steps provided in this [blog](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/04/how-to-install-firefox-deb-apt-ubuntu-22-04). You only need to run step 1 to 6 to finish the installation, everything can be copy and pasted right into bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When installation is done, you can check whether Firefox can be run within the container by running `firefox -headless` or checking if the web driver can establish a connecting using the code provided below.\n",

    "You should be able to run the following cells after the steps above."
